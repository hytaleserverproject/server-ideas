# Setting up the Server

## Hardware
- Development (Raspberry Pi 3B+ running DietPi)
- Production (DigitalOcean/Vultr)

## Software
- Hypixel will probably release a Java Server package for Linux/Debian, which we can self-host
- Mods are server-side, though there's no documentation for them yet
- Minecraft Server software like MineOS, written in Java, should be a similar idea

## Cost
- $40-80/month likely (if it's a reasonable size - like ~50 people, but not scalable)
- ~$300/month if we need to have 100s/1000s of players; monetization needs to happen ASAP or it'll get too expensive

## In the Meantime
- Do more research/testing
- Maybe make a Minecraft server as a test?
- Learn Java
